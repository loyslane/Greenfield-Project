Can't Stop app

This app will be based on the board game called "Can't Stop".
The game will take 2-4 players and is a turn based game.
Each player will choose a color (orange, green, yellow, blue).
On each player's turn, they will roll 4 D6 and pair up the dice however they please.
They'll take the numbers from those pairs and move temporary markers up a track that varies depending on the number, with 2 and 12 being the shortest track (with 3 spaces) and 7 being the longest track (with 13 spaces).
There are only 3 temporary markers.
They'll repeat the process until they decide they want to stop or until they bust (meaning they cannot move any temporary markers because they don't have any numbers that the markers are on).
If they end their turn voluntarily, they replace the temporary markers with their colored markers, preserving their spot for the next round.
If they get their colored markers to the last space of the track (the numbered space), they win that number.
Only one marker can make it to the end of each number.
The game ends when one player wins three numbers.

Todo:
Database collections: 
  -create users for players to log in so they can play their games, tracking which games they're playing and which turn they're on, and stats for each player to track how many games they've won.
  -create a db of current games being played with where each of the colored markers are on the board, and whose turn it is.
Other:
  -roll dice and show possible combos.
  -mark where the temporary markers are.
  -some way for players to choose to stop their turn or keep playing."# Greenfield-Project"
